📊 Project Title: Student Habits vs Academic Performance

📝 Summary

This project explores how students’ daily habits including study time, mental health, screen time, and sleep influence their academic performance. Using a dataset of over 1,000 students, I applied statistical analysis and visualizations to uncover the habits that most significantly impact exam scores.


❓ Problem Statement

Students often underperform academically, but the specific habits contributing to success or struggle are not always clear. This project aims to answer:

“Can students improve their academic performance and well-being by adjusting their daily habits?”

The goal is to help educators and student support teams identify actionable areas for improvement.


🛠️ Tools Used
 • Google Sheets: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
 • Statistical Methods:
 • Multiple Regression
 • Correlation Analysis
 • Independent Samples T-Test
 • Google Sheets: Dashboard design


🔍 Steps Taken
 1. Data Cleaning
 Reviewed for invalid or inconsistent entries (all data valid)
 Auto-fitted rows and columns for readability
 Verified there were no missing values
 Checked for and confirmed no duplicates
 Ensured all columns had the correct data types
 Categorized habits (e.g., study time, sleep hours, mental health scores)
 2. Data Analysis
  Ran multiple regression to assess the impact of different habits on exam scores
  Calculated correlation coefficients for key variables
  Conducted t-test to compare performance between high vs low mental health groups
 4. Data Visualization
  Scatter plot for study time vs grades
  Bar chart for habit impact on performance
  Pie chart for mental health distribution among top scorers
  KPI cards summarizing average values of key habits
 5. Dashboard Creation
  Designed an interactive dashboard showcasing all insights and KPIs


📌 Key Findings
 • Study time has the strongest positive effect on exam scores
 • Mental health positively correlates with higher grades
 • Screen time (Netflix, social media) negatively impacts performance
 • Most top scorers have both high mental health ratings and higher study hours



✅ Recommendations
 • Encourage students to maintain consistent study routines
 • Invest in mental health resources for students
 • Implement programs to guide healthy screen habits
 • Use this data-driven approach to tailor academic support interventions
